# each module in Python is either:
# 1) custom - I wrote it
# 2) built-in - Comes with the python installation
# 3) 3rd party - someone wrote it and it is located in the Python main modules repository
#
# there are two ways to import module
# import modA
#
# modA.Func()

# or, do:
# from modA import *
#
# Func()
